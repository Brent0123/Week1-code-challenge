Code Challenges

This repository contains solutions for three different coding challenges written in JavaScript. Each solution is in its own file and demonstrates a specific problem-solving approach.
Challenges:
1. Grade Generator

This challenge prompts the user to input student marks and then assigns a grade based on the following scale:

    A: Marks greater than 79
    B: Marks between 60 and 79
    C: Marks between 50 and 59
    D: Marks between 40 and 49
    E: Marks less than 40

2. Speed Detector

This program takes the speed of a car as input, checks if the speed is below the speed limit, and if not, calculates the demerit points. If the driver accumulates more than 12 points, their license is suspended.
Code: challenge2.js



3. Salary Calculator

This program calculates a user's PAYE (Tax), NHIF deductions, NSSF deductions, and the net salary after deductions. It uses a basic salary and additional benefits to compute the gross salary and deductions.                                                                                   License
